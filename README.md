Oh man, just stumbled out of The Woman in the Yard and I dunno, my mind is kinda like... Popcorn pieces everywhere on the seat, and that sticky soda smell lingering, you know? Anyway, trying to text, thumbs still figuring out how to type words like they didn't just see, I dunno, madness??

The opening scene with that dang crow just flew right at my face and I swear I dropped my phone. Haha. And the yard, the yard, constantly looming. Seeing it felt like staring into the leftover spaghetti I spilled onto my rug last week, just a mess but you can't look away.

> And the music!! My ears are echoing this haunting tune, like cicadas but mixed with that neighbor's annoying leaf blower in the distance, you know the one. I floated out the theater like I just stepped off a carousel. Lines were a blur, people whispering, munching, it felt like a circus inside a 𝘭𝘪𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘳𝘺. 

The actors, omg, felt like they walked straight out of a foggy dream. The lead reminded me of my high school art teacher, Mrs. Belmont, with that wild hair-scrawled-blackboard energy. She really brought the crazy eyes, those eyes that said There’s something here, like when you leave bread on the counter and ants find it.

Anyway, someone remind me later to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or maybe legally 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   first before recommending it? My back’s killing me from those seats btw. 

Gotta hand it to the director for doing that one scene — YOU know the one — really captured the essence of Monday stubbed-toe feeling. It’s hard to explain without sounding insane but trust me. 

And the way they 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮ed the squirrels in the yard, almost tasted like cold pizza, familiar but unsettling if you microwave too long. Reminescent of that one summer I spent chasing them with a watergun, idk. Oh, and what was with that random shot of the staircase? Reminded me of vertigo like a spinning office chair after one too many coffees.

Hold on — sorry, thinking now, didn't Jess once talk about this? 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for later, maybe she figures some bits would fit her jigsaw.

All in all, who knew existential dread mixed with garden tools could mess up one's sense of direction and time. I’m still dazed, walking through this parking lot felt like crossing the Sahara without Google Maps.
